# Cricdata-Analysis

This project is to scrape, process, analyze, and visualize cricket match data available at Cricsheet using Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly in Python.
The project raodmap overview as follows,

  1.  Web Scraping Cricsheet JSON URLs using Selenium
  2.  Downloading JSON files and organizing by match type
  3.  Storing match data in SQL database
  4.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
  5.  Writing 20 SQL queries for cricket insights
  6.  Creating a Power BI Dashboard

## STEP 1: Download the Datasets
  1.  Start with 1_4_Cricdata_Analysis.ipynb file.
  2.  The code would be downloaded the datasets automatically using selenium package in Python.

## STEP 2: Extract the downloaded zip files
  1.  You just follow the cells one by one.

## STEP 3: Storing exctracted JSON files into SQLite Database
  1.  You just follow the cells one by one.
  2.  It will store all the JSON file into the SQLite database.
  3.  The file also here, name  as 'cricket_matches.db'.

## STEP 4: EDA using matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
  1.  You just follow the cells one by one.
  2.  The codes will be friendly and easy to understand.
  3.  I used all kind of graphs

## STEP 5: Writing 20 SQL Queries
  1. You just follow the file named as '5_Queries for Cricdata Analysis'.
  2. I have written around 20 queries for the validation purpose.

## STEP 6: Creating a Power BI Dashboard
  1. The file, I have shared and named as '6_Cricdata_Analysis_in_Power_BI.pbix'.
  2. Its made by simple way.

Hense, the project has been completed successfully.
